I HAVENT TOUCHED ANY CODE OUTSIDE OF CONNECTION, IT WILL NEED TO USE THE NEW LIST LENGTH (67) AND COLUMNS

TEST EFFICACY OF MODELS ON NEW DATA ASAP

The 14 updated files and 8 new files are in the google drive
All the data in the files are compatable with each other since the names, IP & timestamps being different were the main reasons to avoid mixing the datasets
More details about specific code changes are in the Connection comments

Some methods have been developed to manipulate data further, but most have been made obsolete by the removal of names, IP, & timestamps
